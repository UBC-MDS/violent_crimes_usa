## Concept

The purpose of this Shiny App is to allow the general public to easily access and understand crime data in major US cities between 1975-2014. It shows data for four major crime types: homicide, rape, aggrevated assault, and robbery. It allows users to compare crime rates across cities and for specific cities over time.
